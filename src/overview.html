        <p>FoodMood is an application and service for analyzing the correlation
            between foods eaten and moods experienced on a daily basis. 

            Users log the foods they eat and the moods they experience each day.

            The analytics views show a log of foods and moods recorded, a line
            chart showing the mood levels over time, and a scatterplot that 
            shows the correlation between the number of foods eaten in a food
            group and the moods experienced.
